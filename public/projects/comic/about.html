        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>As far as his homesteading wife is concerned, Bletcher bathes in the mundane juices of his mundane corporate job salarayman sweat.

        <p>Unbeknownst to her, Bletcher is a serial adventerer of faraway planes, risking life and limb against all odds with nothing but his briefcase and stale corporate decorum. All to return home with a new magical gift each day for his lovely wife.</p>
