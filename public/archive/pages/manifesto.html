    <p>1. This website will forever stand as rejection of the modern modes of monetisation. No ads. No sponsorships. Any avenues for profit come from my own hard work and the conscious choice of you, the viewer.</p>
    <p>2. The webmaster (me hehe) will continue to support neighbouring webmasters in their web building endeavors, and encourage viewers to continue their exploration for cool as shit personal sites.</p>
    <p>3. This website will never promote or tolerate hate, discrimination, harassment, or the glorification of violence/other exploitative materials. NSFW content will always be prefaced.</p>
    <p>If there are any issues, concerns, or further questions, feel free to mail <a href="mailto:taterinx@gmail.com">taterinx@gmail.com</a></p>

    <p>The following text is a long-winded draft and kind of depressing. But it's my current thoughts on what the site is and where it'll go from here. If you read through it in its entirety, thank you (and I'm sorry lol)</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Quick history: some time ago, I had a carrd to act as the super swanky version of a linktree for my social media. It was alright, but I felt like I could go beyond that one day. Then there was the underlying on-off relationship I had with learning Tumblr theme building, an exploration of Everskies profile customisation, and then Spacehey.<br>
    It reached a point where I needed to fully sate an appetite. On the 4th March, 2023, Biggus Boggus was born.</p>
    <p>I wondered how I would justify having a site, specifically about me, completely detached from the land of the automatically laid-out profiles in a melting pot of content. It felt a bit self-centered until I discovered the communities and history behind static site creation, places like Geocities and old-school YouTube.<br> I then reached a pretty cool conclusion in my FAQ:</p>
    <p><em>There's no larger project underpinning the site, nor is it meant as a portfolio/marketing tool for a product. It's an Instagram profile without the Instagram. Just little passions, interests, html snippets and experimentations.<br>Modern social media is alright, I'll always use it to communicate with my irl social circles, but neocities is where cool kids discover other cool kids; bound by nothing but the web code repositories in our heads. It's a bit preachy but it is what it is - this site is <u>just for me.</u></em></p>
    <p>Part of me wants to keep this community of static site builders and old web reminiscers from the mainstream. Twitter can keep its frequent bouts of toxicity, and Instagram can keep its content farms. Part of me also thinks that's selfish and counterproductive, to keep the hope of a fully free web under wraps because I lack hope in our societies to collectively respect our ethos.<br>
      My stance on the internet will remain messy in this way for some time, I have the smallest memories of how things used to look and feel almost left out of that era of the web. I also don't want to feel left out of my social circles. And I like when the suspcious algorithms feed me cat videos and Monster High G1 v G3 debate.</p>
    <p>I also realised that there was a discourse around this idea of web nostalgia, that in all its nature to appreciate an archiac culture, it breeds a certain kind of people who get a high from this newfound freedom to craft something, only to craft something lacking in humanity. <a href="http://archives.somnolescent.net/web/mari_nc2/essays/passion.html">This essay prompted some thought.</a> Definitely read it.<br>
      It was definitely written to get some people talking, and I can't say whether or not I fully agree with the sentiments. But also, is it my place to disagree or agree? I'm very new to this. In any case, the anxieties started hitting, all over again. I don't have any cool trivia that no one's heard of, I only have myself, and I suck.<br></p>
      <p>Eventually, though, I had to fight against that line of thinking. I'm an artist, I can and aspire to become a full time artist, game developer, music producer, and a rambler for all the things I care to ramble about, like RuPaul's Drag Race, why Lego: Pirates of the Caribbean rocks, and why Discord has become a hellscape like the very platforms it initially aimed to separate itself from. The unfortunate thing here is that I'm battling a depression.<br>
      I never wanted it to be an excuse really, but it stands as the reason for why I've yet to turn this site into an avenue for all the creative talents I allude to possessing, or the interests I imply I have. If anything, this site stands as environmental storytelling: as I heal, the site will breathe more life, beyond my amusement of the Windows XP aesthetic.<br>
      There's probably some counter-argument that these silly little sites shouldn't be taken so seriously, that the sites that don't offer much but a visual spectacle can very easily be moved on from. Then there's the counter-counter-argument that those sites nevertheless multiply like a virus in webrings and search results, and that they say they're for fun and then piss their pants at invalidation. Then I get a headache and try to stop thinking about it.</p>
    <p>A big discussion can very well be had about the internet, it's a contentious piece of cultural phenomena. But at the end of the day, this site is only 2 months old, and my intentions stretch much further than to indulge a bit in some web nostalgia then piss off. This site grows with me. I'm not really trying to make any bold statements. Not yet.</p>
