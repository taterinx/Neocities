<html> <!-- Iframes are some of the coolest pieces of html yet, if you want to keep all the necessary functions of your site javascript-free. Not that I'm against that, but I always read about how it's more a last-resort in the name of accessibility. Interesting how you went out of your way to find this one, though. It's cool. These are the calmer extracts of code you could probably stumble across. How's your day been? (1/?) -->

      <p>About a year ago, a friend discovered SpaceHey and a few of us got together to make our profiles and exchange them. That was pretty neat. I don't talk to them anymore but I owe it to them to mention that, because that's what eventually led Biggus Boggus/Inx Browser/whatever to its creation.</p>
      <p>Perhaps. Turn back time and you'll find that I always had a curiosity for personal webspaces. I never grew up on Tumblr but I was enamoured to hell by all the custom code floating around. Couldn't understand jack so it never became much more than musings of a fifteen year old.</p>
      <p>Whatever the case, I'm now twenty and finally understanding all the knick knacks that go into making these static sites. And I'm comfortable enough with sharing the resources, tools, and tuts that went into creating Biggus Boggus/Inx Browser/whatever. Peruse to your hearts' content.</p>

            <a href="https://botoxparty.github.io/XP.css/">XP.css</a><br>
            A CSS library emulating the styles of retro Windows OS', intended to be imported. I, however, refer to it as more a bible for how to style elements, so that I can understand its components for myself.
          </span></li>
        <li><span>
            <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a><br>
            The easiest way to import custom fonts. Con: you can only import what they host; Pro: they've got some neat options - I use DotGothic16, but also recommend VT323 and silkscreen!

            The pixelated halftone effect on my pictures? That's dithering, and this website does it for free online to any image you run through it. Lots of neat settings to play around with!

        <li><span>
          <a href="https://www.imood.com/">imood.com</a><br>
          Very similar to Status Cafe: send an update, it appears on your site. This time in the form of a cute widget of your specific mood (naturally). You can also elaborate - though that won't sync over to your site.

          <a href="https://pastebin.com/PiDgrv3J">Multi-track custom music player</a><br>
          Courtesy of Adilene.net. Very easy to customise with your own CSS, including rearranging the elements entirely. I managed to fit it within my theme! Plus some useful labels in the Javascript section for further adjustments.
