            <p>I grew up at the peak of flash games and online virtual worlds. Club Penguin, GirlsGoGames, and Happy Wheels to name a few formative childhood experiences. I was a bit of a recluse as a result, but I'd say it has allowed me to develop greater empathy when communicating online - having seen and been part of the good and the bad parts of it. Seeing the decline of these games has also fueled my interest for web revival in the current day!</p>
            <p>Fast forward a bit, I had a Carrd to act as the super swanky version of a linktree for my social media. It was alright, but I felt like I could go beyond that one day. Then there was the underlying on-off relationship I had with learning Tumblr theme building, an exploration of Everskies profile customisation, and then Spacehey. It reached a point where I needed to fully sate an appetite. On the 4th March, 2023, Biggus Boggus was born. Not only that, but a newfound (but also longtime coming) interest in web 1.0, and the online culture I was too young for by the slightest margin. That was devastating to me, to have missed out on the web when it embraced everything I love about art and subjectivity.</p>
            <p>A proper manifesto regarding my take on the current state of the internet is coming soon, as I believe a lot can be said about how old web philosophies can coexist with current developments. My Instagram account's intact.</p>

            <summary>Why the name Biggus? Better yet, what's a Taterinx?</summary>
            <p>There's such a things as potatoes. On the 15th year (16? I think 15), God created all manner of tater tot based usernames. By God, I mean myself. Such a Tumblr way of naming yourself, isn't it? I didn't even know how to use Tumblr back in the day, honestly.</p>
            <p>I floated between a few different names: atomic_tatertot, tatertotter, etc. and then made a dooky little Instagram meme account called taterrotter or something similar. I thought about my tater tot empire, the tater tot incorporated. Inc. Inx. Taterinx. We were no longer on about potatoes. I felt like I served branding on a plate and ate it up like a Sunday roast except just the Yorkshire puddings and potatoes and sorta awkwardly picking at the mushy boiled carrots and secretly scooping the nasty greens onto my sister's plate.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to watching Monty Python and thinking Biggus Dickus was the funniest shit imaginable. I became Biggus Vickus for a while, though those unaware of the referential nature behind it just called me Biggus. I thought it was cute. Vickus sounds so phlegm-like.</p>
            <p>Still have no idea what a Metaxas is though.</p>
