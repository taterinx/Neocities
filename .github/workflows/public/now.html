      <h2>Academics (and Work)</h2>
      <p>I graduated from my undergrad degree this summer, with a Bachelor's in Media Studies. From the beginning, I was uncertain of my career path, but staying in education seemed less intimidating than going straight into work. Now, I feel like I've been penalised for choosing such a broad subject, for having too many interests and no specialisations to bring to the workforce. I'm as lost as I was years ago.</p>
      <p>In a weird way, though, I do have some sense of direction which has kept me going. I started an internship for a start-up company in film reviews and industry interviews, I get to work remotely and at flexible hours. It's unpaid but it gives me something to do these next six months, and at least it pertains to my interests.</p>
      <p>Still job hunting, though, and I have some greater ambitions. I always have, but they fizzle into nothing more than daydreams. That habit has haunted me for ages so I hope to improve on that front, to actually do something with my endless ideas. I'd like to be a tattoo artist, a multi-media illustrator, a content creator. Not necessarily for profit, just to expel all that happens in my head. I know I really need that. But, for now, I'm looking for a livable wage. Amidst the abyssmal job market, I simply want to work to live, <em>not</em> the other way around.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I've always jumped between videogames, but right now I've been getting into the Yakuza series, having recently completed Yakuza 0. Fortnite's also been such a fun experience, but this current season is only fully enjoyable in a squad for me personally. I'm contemplating picking up the Metal Gear franchise again, since I only got about an hour into the second Solid game. Balatro has me by the bollocks, but its one of those games I feel like playing so strongly, rage after a moment, and don't touch it until the next time I feel compelled to (at least a couple hours later.) I encouraged my partner to play Kingdom Hearts, so I'm also revisiting that.</p>
      <p>My art block has been going on forever, but over the past year I've really thrown myself into scrapbooking and jouranling - I was in an otherwise on/off relationship with it.</p>
      <p>Since early 2023, I've gotten into the personal webspace. I've made cute static sites, almost completed them, moved onto something else. I love utilising the option to customise my CSS, pushing it to its absolute limits, on platforms like SpaceHey and Bearblog. I also love my little Neocities projects. The sad thing, however, is that I still feel lonely. I wish my friends shared the same enthusiasm for making personal things online, and I wish it was less intimidating reaching out to strangers. Online communications felt so easy as a kid, but now I just want to feel my current friendships permeate into those quite nights alone. I guess I miss after-school Skype calls, and I realise I should've treated my friends better.</p>

      <h2>Relationship & Family</h2>
      <p>Fletcher and I have been together since March 2022, so about two and almost a half years right now. Our families got to finally meet at our graduation, and it seems they've hit it off really well. It was also really nice getting to show his parents around town. With his undergraduate degree over now, Fletcher plans to take the year back in Chicago, with his family, to seek employment and possibly internships that'll leverage his career path into psychiatry. We've been training for this moment in our relationship, with all those summers and Christmas' apart. It stings a little still, but I know we're both in it for the long term.</p>
      <p>I think my family are well. I want to do the best I can for them. I've started calorie counting.</p>
